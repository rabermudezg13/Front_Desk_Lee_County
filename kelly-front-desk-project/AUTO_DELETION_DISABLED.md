# Automatic Record Deletion - DISABLED

## üõë Changes Made

The automatic daily deletion of records at 6:00 AM has been **completely disabled** to preserve all data permanently.

## ‚úÖ What Was Changed

### 1. **Disabled Automatic Scheduling**
- **Removed**: `setInterval(checkDailyArchive, 60 * 60 * 1000)` - No longer runs every hour
- **Removed**: `window.addEventListener('load', checkDailyArchive)` - No longer checks on page load
- **Function**: `checkDailyArchive()` now only logs that it's disabled

### 2. **Updated User Interface Text**

#### **Before:**
- "Historical data automatically archived daily at 6:00 AM"
- "System automatically archives all data daily at 6:00 AM and clears current collections"
- "Records from 6:00 AM onwards"

#### **After:**
- "Historical data is preserved permanently - no automatic deletion"
- "All data is now preserved permanently - automatic deletion has been disabled"
- "All records preserved permanently"

### 3. **Updated Manual Archive Feature**

#### **Changed from WARNING to INFORMATIONAL**
- **Before**: Yellow warning box - "Use with caution!"
- **After**: Blue info box - "Optional backup creation"

#### **Updated Button Text**
- **Before**: "üì¶ Perform Manual Archive Now" (btn-warning)
- **After**: "üì¶ Create Archive Backup" (info style)

#### **Updated Confirmation Dialog**
- **Before**: "Are you sure you want to archive all current data and clear the collections? This action cannot be undone."
- **After**: "Create a backup archive of current data? All original records will remain preserved in their collections. This is just for backup purposes."

#### **Updated Success Message**
- **Before**: "Daily archive completed successfully - Historical data preserved"
- **After**: "Backup archive created successfully - All original records remain preserved permanently"
